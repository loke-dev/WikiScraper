programming language envisioned refinement style languages classified third-generation programming language 3gl each programming language generations aims provide higher level abstraction internal computer hardware details making language more programmer -friendly powerful versatile while definition 4gl has changed over time can be typified by operating more with large collections information at once rather than focusing on just bits bytes languages claimed be 4gl may include support for database management report generation mathematical optimization gui development web development some researchers state that 4gls are subset domain-specific languages concept 4gl was developed from 1970s through 1990s overlapping most development 3gl while 3gls like c c++ c java javascript remain popular for wide variety uses 4gls originally defined found narrower uses some advanced 3gls like python ruby perl combine some 4gl abilities within general-purpose 3gl environment also libraries with 4gl-like features have been developed add-ons for most popular 3gls this has blurred distinction 4gl 3gl 1980s 1990s there were efforts develop fifth-generation programming languages 5gl contents history types examples see also references external links history though used earlier papers discussions term 4gl was first used formally by james martin his book applications development without programmers refer non-procedural high-level specification languages some primitive way early 4gls were included informatics mark-iv product sperry's mapper internal use release motivations for '4gl' inception continued interest are several term can apply large set software products can also apply approach that looks for greater semantic properties implementation power just 3gl offered greater power programmer so too did 4gl open up development environment wider population sense 4gl example 'black box' processing each generation sense page further from machine see computer science history regard data structure improvements information hiding this latter nature that directly associated with 4gl having errors that are harder many cases debug terms applications 4gl could be business oriented could deal with some technical domain being further from machine implies being closer domain given wide disparity concepts methods across domains 4gl limitations lead recognition need for 5gl early input scheme for 4gl supported entry data within 72-character limit punched card bytes used for sequencing where card's tag would identify type function with judicious use few cards 4gl deck could offer wide variety processing reporting capability whereas equivalent functionality coded 3gl could subsume perhaps whole box more cards 72-character metaphor continued for while hardware progressed larger memory terminal interfaces even with its limitations this approach supported highly sophisticated applications interfaces improved allowed longer statement lengths grammar-driven input handling greater power ensued example this described on nomad page another example nomad's power illustrated by nicholas rawlings his comments for computer history museum about ncss see citation below he reports that james martin asked rawlings for nomad solution standard problem martin called engineer's problem give 6% raises engineers whose job ratings had average better martin provided dozen pages cobol then just page two mark iv from informatics rawlings offered following single statement performing set-at-a-time operation development 4gl was influenced by several factors with hardware operating system constraints having large weight when 4gl was first introduced disparate mix hardware operating systems mandated custom application development support that was specific system order ensure sales one example mapper system developed by sperry though has roots back beginning system has proven successful many applications has been ported modern platforms latest variant embedded bis offering unisys mark-iv now known visionbuilder offered by computer associates santa fe railroad used mapper develop system project that was early example 4gl rapid prototyping programming by users idea was that was easier teach railroad experts use mapper than teach programmers intricacies railroad operations one early portable languages that had 4gl properties was ramis developed by gerald c cohen at mathematica mathematical software company cohen left mathematica founded information builders create similar reporting-oriented 4gl called focus later 4gl types are tied database system are far different from earlier types their use techniques resources that have resulted from general improvement computing with time interesting twist 4gl scene realization that graphical interfaces related reasoning done by user form 'language' that poorly understood types number different types 4gls exist table-driven codeless programming usually running with runtime framework libraries instead using code developer defines their logic by selecting operation pre-defined list memory data table manipulation commands other words instead coding developer uses table-driven algorithm programming see also control tables that can be used for this purpose good example this type 4gl language powerbuilder these types tools can be used for business application development usually consisting package allowing for both business data manipulation reporting therefore they come with gui screens report editors they usually offer integration with lower level dlls generated from typical 3gl for when need arise for more hardware/os specific operations report-generator programming languages take description data format report generate from that they either generate required report directly they generate program generate report see also rpg similarly forms generators manage online interactions with application system users generate programs do so more ambitious 4gls sometimes termed fourth generation environments attempt automatically generate whole systems from outputs case tools specifications screens reports possibly also specification some additional processing logic data management 4gls such sas spss stata provide sophisticated coding commands for data manipulation file reshaping case selection data documentation preparation data for statistical analysis reporting some 4gls have integrated tools which allow for easy specification all required information james martin's version information engineering systems development
