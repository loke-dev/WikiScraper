field many more still are being created every year many programming languages require computation be specified imperative form ie sequence operations perform while other languages use other forms program specification such declarative form ie desired result specified not how achieve description programming language usually split into two components syntax form semantics meaning some languages are defined by specification document for example c programming language specified by iso standard while other languages such perl have dominant implementation that treated reference some languages

notation for writing programs which are specifications computation algorithm some but not all authors restrict term programming language those languages that can express all possible algorithms traits often considered important for what constitutes programming language include function target computer programming language language used write computer programs which involve computer performing some kind computation algorithm possibly control external devices such printers disk drives robots so on for example postscript programs are frequently created by another program control computer printer display more generally programming language may describe computation on some possibly abstract machine generally accepted that complete specification for programming language includes description possibly idealized machine processor for that language most practical contexts programming language involves computer consequently programming languages are usually defined studied this way programming languages differ from natural languages that natural languages are only used for interaction between people while programming languages also allow humans communicate instructions machines abstractions programming languages usually contain abstractions for defining manipulating data structures controlling flow execution practical necessity that programming language support adequate abstractions expressed by abstraction principle this principle sometimes formulated recommendation programmer make proper use such abstractions expressive power theory computation classifies languages by computations they are capable expressing all turing complete languages can implement same set algorithms ansi/iso sql-92 charity are examples languages that are not turing complete yet often called programming languages markup languages like xml html troff which define structured data are not usually considered programming languages programming languages may however share syntax with markup languages if computational semantics defined xslt for example turing complete xml dialect moreover latex which mostly used for structuring documents also contains turing complete subset term computer language sometimes used interchangeably with programming language however usage both terms varies among authors including exact scope each one usage describes programming languages subset computer languages this vein languages used computing that have different goal than expressing computer programs are generically designated computer languages for instance markup languages are sometimes referred computer languages emphasize that they are not meant be used for programming another usage regards programming languages theoretical constructs for programming abstract machines computer languages subset thereof that runs on physical computers which have finite hardware resources john c reynolds emphasizes that formal specification languages are just much programming languages are languages intended for execution he also argues that textual even graphical input formats that affect behavior computer are programming languages despite fact they are commonly not turing-complete remarks that ignorance programming language concepts reason for many flaws input formats history main article history programming languages early developments earliest computers were often programmed without help programming language by writing programs absolute machine language programs decimal binary form were read from punched cards magnetic tape toggled on switches on front panel computer absolute machine languages were later termed first-generation programming languages 1gl next step was development so-called second-generation programming languages 2gl assembly languages which were still closely tied instruction set architecture specific computer these served make program much more human-readable relieved programmer tedious error-prone address calculations first high-level programming languages third-generation programming languages 3gl were written 1950s early high-level programming language be designed for computer was plankalkül developed for german z3 by konrad zuse between however was not implemented until john mauchly's short code proposed was one first high-level languages ever developed for electronic computer unlike machine code short code statements represented mathematical expressions understandable form however program had be translated into machine code every time ran making process much slower than running equivalent machine code manchester mark ran programs written autocode from at university manchester alick glennie developed autocode early 1950s programming language used compiler automatically convert language into machine code first code compiler was developed for mark computer at university manchester considered be first compiled high-level programming language second autocode was developed for mark by r brooker was called mark autocode brooker also developed autocode for ferranti mercury 1950s conjunction with university manchester version for edsac was devised by d f hartley university cambridge mathematical laboratory known edsac autocode was straight development from mercury autocode adapted for local circumstances was noted for its object code optimisation source-language diagnostics which were advanced for time contemporary but separate thread development atlas autocode was developed for university manchester atlas machine language fortran was invented at ibm by john backus was first widely used high level general purpose programming language have functional implementation opposed just design on paper still popular language for high-performance computing used for programs that benchmark rank world's fastest supercomputers another early programming language was devised by grace hopper us called flow-matic was developed for univac i at remington rand during period from until hopper found that business data processing customers were uncomfortable with mathematical notation early she her team wrote specification for english programming language implemented prototype flow-matic compiler became publicly available early was substantially complete flow-matic was major influence design cobol since only its direct descendant aimaco were actual use at time refinement increased use high-level languages introduced requirement for low-level programming languages system programming languages these languages varying degrees provide facilities between assembly languages high-level languages can be used perform tasks which require direct access hardware facilities but still provide higher-level control structures error-checking period from 1960s late 1970s brought development major language paradigms now use apl introduced array programming influenced functional programming algol refined both structured procedural programming discipline language specification revised report on algorithmic language algol became model for how later language specifications were written lisp implemented was first dynamically typed functional programming language 1960s simula was first language designed support object-oriented programming mid-1970s smalltalk followed with first purely object-oriented language c was developed between system programming language for unix operating system remains popular prolog designed was first logic programming language ml built polymorphic type system on top lisp pioneering statically typed functional programming languages each these languages spawned descendants most modern programming languages count at least one them their ancestry 1960s 1970s also saw considerable debate over merits structured programming whether programming languages should be designed support edsger dijkstra famous letter published communications acm argued that goto statements should be eliminated from all higher level programming languages consolidation growth selection textbooks that teach programming languages both popular obscure these are only few thousands programming languages dialects that have been designed history 1980s were years relative consolidation c++ combined object-oriented systems programming united states government standardized ada systems programming language derived from pascal intended for use by defense contractors japan elsewhere vast sums were spent investigating so-called fifth generation languages that incorporated logic programming constructs functional languages community moved standardize ml lisp rather than inventing new paradigms all these movements elaborated upon ideas invented previous decades one important trend language design for programming large-scale systems during 1980s was increased focus on use modules large-scale organizational units code modula-2 ada ml all developed notable module systems 1980s which were often wedded generic programming constructs rapid growth internet mid-1990s created opportunities for new languages perl originally unix scripting tool first released became common dynamic websites java came be used for server-side programming bytecode virtual machines became popular again commercial settings with their promise write once run anywhere ucsd pascal had been popular for time early 1980s these developments were not fundamentally novel rather they were refinements many existing languages paradigms although their syntax was often based on c family programming languages programming language evolution continues both industry research current directions include security reliability verification new kinds modularity mixins delegates aspects database integration such microsoft's linq fourth-generation programming languages 4gl are computer programming languages which aim provide higher level abstraction internal computer hardware details than 3gls fifth generation programming languages 5gl are programming languages based on solving problems using constraints given program rather than using algorithm written by programmer elements all programming languages have some primitive building blocks for description data processes transformations applied them like addition two numbers selection item from collection these primitives are defined by syntactic semantic rules which describe their structure meaning respectively syntax main article syntax programming languages parse tree python code with inset tokenization syntax highlighting often used aid programmers recognizing elements source code language above python programming language's surface form known its syntax most programming languages are purely textual they use sequences text including words numbers punctuation much like written natural languages on other hand there are some programming languages which are more graphical nature using visual relationships between symbols specify program syntax language describes possible combinations symbols that form syntactically correct program meaning given combination symbols handled by semantics either formal hard-coded reference implementation since most languages are textual this article discusses textual syntax programming language syntax usually defined using combination regular expressions for lexical structure backus–naur form for grammatical structure below simple grammar based on lisp expression = atom | list atom = number | symbol number = + symbol = list = '' expression '' this grammar specifies following expression either atom list atom either number symbol number unbroken sequence one more decimal digits optionally preceded by plus minus sign symbol letter followed by zero more any characters excluding whitespace list matched pair parentheses with zero more expressions inside following are examples well-formed token sequences this grammar b c232 not all syntactically correct programs are semantically correct many syntactically correct programs are nonetheless ill-formed per language's rules may depending on language specification soundness implementation result error on translation execution some cases such programs may exhibit undefined behavior even when program well-defined within language may still have meaning that not intended by person who wrote using natural language example may not be possible assign meaning grammatically correct sentence sentence may be false colorless green ideas sleep furiously grammatically well-formed but has no generally accepted meaning john married bachelor grammatically well-formed but expresses meaning that cannot be true following c language fragment syntactically correct but performs operations that are not semantically defined operation p >> has no meaning for value having complex type p->im not defined because value p null pointer complex p = null complex absp = sqrtp >> + p->im if type declaration on first line were omitted program would trigger error on compilation variable p would not be defined but program would still be syntactically correct since type declarations provide only semantic information grammar needed specify programming language can be classified by its position chomsky hierarchy syntax most programming languages can be specified using type-2 grammar ie they are context-free grammars some languages including perl lisp contain constructs that allow execution during parsing phase languages that have constructs that allow programmer alter behavior parser make syntax analysis undecidable problem generally blur distinction between parsing execution contrast lisp's macro system perl's begin blocks which may contain general computations c macros are merely string replacements do not require code execution semantics term semantics refers meaning languages opposed their form syntax static semantics static semantics defines restrictions on structure valid texts that are hard impossible express standard syntactic formalisms for compiled languages static semantics essentially include those semantic rules that can be checked at compile time examples include checking that every identifier declared before used languages that require such declarations that labels on arms case statement are distinct many important restrictions this type like checking that identifiers are used appropriate context eg not adding integer function name that subroutine calls have appropriate number type arguments can be enforced by defining them rules logic called type system other forms static analyses like data flow analysis may also be part static semantics newer programming languages like java c have definite assignment analysis form data flow analysis part their static semantics dynamic semantics main article semantics programming languages once data has been specified machine must be instructed perform operations on data for example semantics may define strategy by which expressions are evaluated values manner which control structures conditionally execute statements dynamic semantics also known execution semantics language defines how when various constructs language should produce program behavior there are many ways defining execution semantics natural language often used specify execution semantics languages commonly used practice significant amount academic research went into formal semantics programming languages which allow execution semantics be specified formal manner results from this field research have seen limited application programming language design implementation outside academia type system main articles data type type system type safety type system defines how programming language classifies values expressions into types how can manipulate those types how they interact goal type system verify usually enforce certain level correctness programs written that language by detecting certain incorrect operations any decidable type system involves trade-off while rejects many incorrect programs can also prohibit some correct albeit unusual programs order bypass this downside number languages have type loopholes usually unchecked casts that may be used by programmer explicitly allow normally disallowed operation between different types most typed languages type system used only type check programs but number languages usually functional ones infer types relieving programmer from need write type annotations formal design study type systems known type theory typed versus untyped languages language typed if specification every operation defines types data which operation applicable with implication that not applicable other types for example data represented by this text between quotes string many programming languages dividing number by string has no meaning will be rejected by compilers invalid operation may be detected when program compiled static type checking will be rejected by compiler with compilation error message may be detected when program run dynamic type checking resulting run-time exception many languages allow function called exception handler be written handle this exception for example always return result special case typed languages are single-type languages these are often scripting markup languages such rexx sgml have only one data type—most commonly character strings which are used for both symbolic numeric data contrast untyped language such most assembly languages allows any operation be performed on any data which are generally considered be sequences bits various lengths high-level languages which are untyped include bcpl tcl some varieties forth practice while few languages are considered typed from point view type theory verifying rejecting all operations most modern languages offer degree typing many production languages provide means bypass subvert type system trading type-safety for finer control over program's execution see casting static versus dynamic typing static typing all expressions have their types determined prior when program executed typically at compile-time for example 2+2 are integer expressions they cannot be passed function that expects string stored variable that defined hold dates statically typed languages can be either manifestly typed type-inferred first case programmer must explicitly write types at certain textual positions for example at variable declarations second case compiler infers types expressions declarations based on context most mainstream statically typed languages such c++ c java are manifestly typed complete type inference has traditionally been associated with less mainstream languages such haskell ml however many manifestly typed languages support partial type inference for example java c both infer types certain limited cases additionally some programming languages allow for some types be automatically converted other types for example int can be used where program expects float dynamic typing also called latent typing determines type-safety operations at run time other words types are associated with run-time values rather than textual expressions with type-inferred languages dynamically typed languages do not require programmer write explicit type annotations on expressions among other things this may permit single variable refer values different types at different points program execution however type errors cannot be automatically detected until piece code actually executed potentially making debugging more difficult lisp smalltalk perl python javascript ruby are dynamically typed weak strong typing weak typing allows value one type be treated another for example treating string number this can occasionally be useful but can also allow some kinds program faults go undetected at compile time even at run time strong typing prevents above attempt perform operation on wrong type value raises error strongly typed languages are often termed type-safe safe alternative definition for weakly typed refers languages such perl javascript which permit large number implicit type conversions javascript for example expression x implicitly converts x number this conversion succeeds even if x null undefined array string letters such implicit conversions are often useful but they can mask programming errors strong static are now generally considered orthogonal concepts but usage literature differs some use term strongly typed mean strongly statically typed even more confusingly mean simply statically typed thus c has been called both strongly typed weakly statically typed may seem odd some professional programmers that c could be weakly statically typed however notice that use generic pointer void pointer does allow for casting pointers other pointers without needing do explicit cast this extremely similar somehow casting array bytes any kind datatype c without using explicit cast such int char standard library run-time system main article standard library most programming languages have associated core library sometimes known 'standard library' especially if included part published language standard which conventionally made available by all implementations language core libraries typically include definitions for commonly used algorithms data structures mechanisms for input output line between language its core library differs from language language some cases language designers may treat library separate entity from language however language's core library often treated part language by its users some language specifications even require that this library be made available all implementations indeed some languages are designed so that meanings certain syntactic constructs cannot even be described without referring core library for example java string literal defined instance javalangstring class similarly smalltalk anonymous function expression block constructs instance library's blockcontext class conversely scheme contains multiple coherent subsets that suffice construct rest language library macros so language designers do not even bother say which portions language must be implemented language constructs which must be implemented parts library design implementation programming languages share properties with natural languages related their purpose vehicles for communication having syntactic form separate from its semantics showing language families related languages branching one from another but artificial constructs they also differ fundamental ways from languages that have evolved through usage significant difference that programming language can be fully described studied its entirety since has precise finite definition by contrast natural languages have changing meanings given by their users different communities while constructed languages are also artificial languages designed from ground up with specific purpose they lack precise complete semantic definition that programming language has many programming languages have been designed from scratch altered meet new needs combined with other languages many have eventually fallen into disuse although there have been attempts design one universal programming language that serves all purposes all them have failed be generally accepted filling this role need for diverse programming languages arises from diversity contexts which languages are used programs range from tiny scripts written by individual hobbyists huge systems written by hundreds programmers programmers range expertise from novices who need simplicity above all else experts who may be comfortable with considerable complexity programs must balance speed size simplicity on systems ranging from microcontrollers supercomputers programs may be written once not change for generations they may undergo continual modification programmers may simply differ their tastes they may be accustomed discussing problems expressing them particular language one common trend development programming languages has been add more ability solve problems using higher level abstraction earliest programming languages were tied very closely underlying hardware computer new programming languages have developed features have been added that let programmers express ideas that are more remote from simple translation into underlying hardware instructions because programmers are less tied complexity computer their programs can do more computing with less effort from programmer this lets them write more functionality per time unit natural language programming has been proposed way eliminate need for specialized language for programming however this goal remains distant its benefits are open debate edsger w dijkstra took position that use formal language essential prevent introduction meaningless constructs dismissed natural language programming foolish alan perlis was similarly dismissive idea hybrid approaches have been taken structured english sql language's designers users must construct number artifacts that govern enable practice programming most important these artifacts are language specification implementation specification main article programming language specification specification programming language artifact that language users implementors can use agree upon whether piece source code valid program that language if so what its behavior shall be programming language specification can take several forms including following explicit definition syntax static semantics execution semantics language while syntax commonly specified using formal grammar semantic definitions may be written natural language eg c language formal semantics eg standard ml scheme specifications description behavior translator for language eg c++ fortran specifications syntax semantics language have be inferred from this description which may be written natural formal language reference model implementation sometimes written language being specified eg prolog ansi rexx syntax semantics language are explicit behavior reference implementation implementation main article programming language implementation implementation programming language provides way write programs that language execute them on one more configurations hardware software there are broadly two approaches programming language implementation compilation interpretation generally possible implement language using either technique output compiler may be executed by hardware program called interpreter some implementations that make use interpreter approach there no distinct boundary between compiling interpreting for instance some implementations basic compile then execute source line at time programs that are executed directly on hardware usually run several orders magnitude faster than those that are interpreted software one technique for improving performance interpreted programs just-in-time compilation here virtual machine just before execution translates blocks bytecode which are going be used machine code for direct execution on hardware proprietary languages this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding

language usage thousands different programming languages have been created mainly computing field software commonly built with programming languages more programming languages differ from most other forms human expression that they require greater degree precision completeness when using natural language communicate with other people human authors speakers can be ambiguous make small errors still expect their intent be understood however figuratively speaking computers do exactly what they are told do cannot understand what code programmer intended write combination language definition program program's inputs must fully specify external behavior that occurs when program executed within domain control that program on other hand ideas about algorithm can be communicated humans without precision required for execution by using pseudocode which interleaves natural language with code written programming language programming language provides structured mechanism for defining pieces data operations transformations that may be carried out automatically on that data programmer uses abstractions present language represent concepts involved computation these concepts are represented collection simplest elements available called primitives programming process by which programmers combine these primitives compose new programs adapt existing ones new uses changing environment programs for computer might be executed batch process without human interaction user might type commands interactive session interpreter this case commands are simply programs whose execution chained together when language can run its commands through interpreter such unix shell other command-line interface without compiling called scripting language measuring language usage main article measuring programming language popularity difficult determine which programming languages are most widely used what usage means varies by context one language may occupy greater number programmer hours different one have more lines code third may consume most cpu time some languages are very popular for particular kinds applications for example cobol still strong corporate data center often on large mainframes fortran scientific engineering applications ada aerospace transportation military real-time embedded applications c embedded applications operating systems other languages are regularly used write many different kinds applications various methods measuring language popularity each subject different bias over what measured have been proposed counting number job advertisements that mention language number books sold that teach describe language estimates number existing lines code written language – which may underestimate languages not often found public searches counts language references ie name language found using web search engine combining averaging information from various internet sites langpopcom claims that ten most popular programming languages are descending order by overall popularity c java php javascript c++ python shell ruby objective-c c taxonomies for more details on this topic see categorical list programming languages there no overarching classification scheme for programming languages given programming language does not usually have single ancestor language languages commonly arise by combining elements several predecessor languages with new ideas circulation at time ideas that originate one language will diffuse throughout family related languages then leap suddenly across familial gaps appear entirely different family task further complicated by fact that languages can be classified along multiple axes for example java both object-oriented language because encourages object-oriented organization concurrent language because contains built-in constructs for running multiple threads parallel python object-oriented scripting language broad strokes programming languages divide into programming paradigms classification by intended domain use with general-purpose programming languages distinguished from domain-specific programming languages traditionally programming languages have been regarded describing computation terms imperative sentences ie issuing commands these are generally called imperative programming languages great deal research programming languages has been aimed at blurring distinction between program set instructions program assertion about desired answer which main feature declarative programming more refined paradigms include procedural programming object-oriented programming functional programming logic programming some languages are hybrids paradigms multi-paradigmatic assembly language not so much paradigm direct model underlying machine architecture by purpose programming languages might be considered general purpose system programming languages scripting languages domain-specific languages concurrent/distributed languages combination these some general purpose languages were designed largely with educational goals programming language may also be classified by factors unrelated programming paradigm for instance most programming languages use
