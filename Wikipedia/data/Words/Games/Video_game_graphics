games that used text characters instead bitmapped vector graphics examples include muds multi-user dungeons where players could read view depictions rooms objects other players actions performed virtual world roguelikes subgenre role-playing video games featuring many monsters items environmental effects well emphasis on randomization replayability permanent death some earliest text games were developed for computer systems which had no video display at all text games are typically easier write require less processing power than graphical games thus were more common from however terminal emulators are still use today people continue play muds explore interactive fiction many beginning programmers still create these types games familiarize themselves with programming language contests are held even today on who can finish programming roguelike within short time period such seven days vector graphics main article vector graphics free software asteroids-like video game played on vector monitor vector graphics refers use geometrical primitives such points lines curves ie shapes based on mathematical equations instead resolution-dependent bitmap graphics represent images computer graphics video games this type projection somewhat rare but has become more common recent years browser-based gaming with advent flash since flash supports vector graphics natively earlier example for personal computer starglider vector game can also refer video game that uses vector graphics display capable projecting images using electron beam draw images instead with pixels much like laser show many early arcade games used such displays they were capable displaying more detailed images than raster displays on hardware available at that time many vector-based arcade games used full-color overlays complement otherwise monochrome vector images other uses these overlays were very detailed drawings static gaming environment while moving objects were drawn by vector beam games this type were produced mainly by atari cinematronics sega examples vector games include armor attack eliminator lunar lander space fury space wars star trek tac/scan tempest zektor vectrex home console also used vector display after use vector graphics declined substantially due improvements sprite technology rasterized filled polygon graphics returned arcades were so popular that vector graphics could no longer compete full motion video main articles full motion video interactive movie full motion video fmv games are video games that rely upon pre-recorded television- movie-quality recordings animations rather than sprites vectors models display action game fmv-based games were popular during early 1990s cd-roms laserdiscs made their way into living rooms providing alternative low-capacity rom cartridges most consoles at time although fmv-based games did manage look better than many contemporary sprite-based games they occupied niche market vast majority fmv games were panned at time their release with many gamers citing their dislike for lack interaction inherent these games result format became well-known failure video gaming popularity fmv games declined substantially after more advanced consoles started become widely available number different types games utilized this format some resembled modern music/dance games where player timely presses buttons according screen instruction others included early rail shooters such tomcat alley surgical strike sewer shark full motion video was also used several interactive movie adventure games such beast within gabriel knight mystery phantasmagoria see also computer graphics parallel projection main article parallel projection games utilizing parallel projection typically make use two-dimensional bitmap graphics opposed 3d-rendered triangle-based geometry allowing developers create large complex gameworlds efficiently with relatively few art assets by dividing art into sprites tiles reusing them repeatedly though some games use mix different techniques top-down perspective example typical top-down third-person view game heist top-down perspective also sometimes referred bird's-eye view overworld overhead view helicopter view when used video games refers camera angle that shows player area around them from above while not exclusive video games that utilise parallel projection was at one time common role playing video games wargames construction management simulation games such simcity pokémon railroad tycoon well action action-adventure games such early legend zelda grand theft auto games side-scrolling game awesomenauts side scrolling moba game main article side-scrolling video game side-scrolling game side-scroller video game which viewpoint taken from side onscreen characters generally move from left side screen right games this type make use scrolling computer display technology sometimes parallax scrolling suggest added depth many games screen follows player character such that player character always positioned near center screen other games position screen will change according player character's movement such that player character off-center more space shown front character than behind sometimes screen will scroll not only forward speed direction player character's movement but also backwards previously visited parts stage other games stages screen will only scroll forwards not backwards so that once stage has been passed can no longer be visited games such shoot 'em ups like r-type screen scrolls forward by itself at steady rate player must keep up with screen attempting avoid obstacles collect things before they pass off screen examples side-scrolling games include platform games such sonic hedgehog beat 'em ups such popular double dragon battletoads shooters such r-type more recently jets'n'guns super mario bros series has used all three types side-scrolling at some time its history 3/4 perspective pseudo-3d main article see also isometric graphics video games parallax scrolling two-and-a-half-dimensional 3/4 perspective pseudo-3d are informal terms used describe graphical projections techniques that try fake three-dimensionality typically by using some form parallel projection wherein point view from fixed perspective but also reveals multiple facets object examples pseudo-3d techniques include isometric/axonometric projection oblique projection orthographic projection billboarding parallax scrolling scaling skyboxes skydomes addition graphical techniques such bump mapping parallax mapping are often used extend illusion three-dimensionality without substantially increasing resulting computational overhead introduced by increasing polygon count terms sometimes possess second meaning wherein gameplay otherwise game forcibly restricted two-dimensional plane examples games that make use pseudo-3d techniques include zaxxon sims diablo isometric/axonometric projection ultima vii paperboy oblique projection sonic hedgehog street fighter ii parallax scrolling fonz space harrier scaling half-life skyboxes addition axonometric projection games such sims final fantasy tactics also make use combination pre-drawn sprites real-time polygonal graphics instead relying entirely on sprites norm see also computer graphics with advent accelerated graphics video games could expand beyond typically sprite-based graphics older graphics technologies describe view frequently more true reality lifelike than their predecessors perspective projection has also been used some earlier titles present view from fixed thus somewhat less hardware-intensive perspective with limited ability move fixed fixed refers three-dimensional representation game world where foreground objects ie game characters are typically rendered real time against static background principal advantage this technique its ability display high level detail on minimal hardware main disadvantage that player's frame reference remains fixed at all times preventing players from examining moving about environment from multiple viewpoints backgrounds fixed games tend be pre-rendered two-dimensional images but are sometimes rendered real time eg blade runner developers simcity took advantage fixed perspective by not texturing reverse sides objects thereby speeding up rendering which players could not see anyway fixed also sometimes used fake areas which are inaccessible players legend zelda ocarina time for instance nearly completely but uses fixed represent many building interiors well one entire town this technique was later dropped favor full-3d game's successor legend zelda majora's mask similar technique skybox used many games represent distant background objects that are not worth rendering real time used heavily survival horror genre fixed was first seen infogrames' alone dark series early 1990s imitated by titles such ecstatica was later brought back by capcom resident evil series gameplay-wise there little difference between fixed games their precursors players' ability navigate within scene still tends be limited interaction with gameworld remains mostly point-and-click further examples include playstation-era titles final fantasy series square role-playing games parasite eve parasite eve ii square action-adventure games ecstatica ecstatica andrew spencer/psygnosis well little big adventure adeline software international graphic adventure grim fandango lucasarts movie maker microsoft kids pre-rendered backgrounds are also found some isometric video games such role-playing game temple elemental evil troika games baldur's gate series bioware though these cases form graphical projection used not different first-person perspective main article first person video games first-person perspective seen stalker shadow chernobyl first person refers graphical perspective rendered from viewpoint player character many cases this may be viewpoint from cockpit vehicle many different genres have made use first-person perspectives ranging from adventure games flight simulators perhaps most notable genre make use this device first-person shooter genre where graphical perspective has immense impact on game play games with first-person perspective are usually avatar-based wherein game displays what player's avatar would see with avatar's own eyes thus players typically cannot see avatar's body though they may be able see avatar's weapons hands this viewpoint also frequently used represent perspective driver within vehicle flight racing simulators common make use positional audio where volume ambient sounds varies depending on their position with respect player's avatar games with first-person perspective do not require sophisticated animations for player's avatar do not need implement manual automated camera-control scheme third-person perspective first person perspective allows for easier aiming since there no representation avatar block player's view however absence avatar can make difficult master timing distances required jump between platforms may cause motion sickness some players players have come expect first-person games accurately scale objects appropriate sizes however key objects such dropped items levers may be exaggerated order improve their visibility third-person perspective main article virtual camera system third person refers graphical perspective rendered from view that some distance away usually behind slightly above from player's character this viewpoint allows players see more strongly characterized avatar most common action action-adventure games this viewpoint poses some difficulties however that when player turns stands with his back wall camera may jerk end up awkward positions developers have tried alleviate this issue by implementing intelligent camera systems by giving player control over camera there are three primary types third-person camera systems fixed camera systems which camera positions are set during game creation tracking camera systems which camera simply follows player's character interactive camera systems that are under player's control examples games utilizing third-person perspective include super mario tomb raider series installments legend zelda series crash bandicoot stereo graphics main article stereoscopic video game stereoscopic video games use stereoscopic technologies create depth perception for player by any form stereo display such games should not be confused with video games that use computer graphics which although they feature graphics on screen do not give illusion depth beyond screen virtual reality headset image captured from oculus rift dk2 showing compensation for lens distortion chromatic aberration main article virtual reality headset graphics for virtual reality gaming consist special kind stereo graphics fit up-close display requirements for latency are also higher reduce potential for virtual reality sickness multi-monitor setup main article video gaming on multi-monitor setups many games can run multi-monitor setups achieve very high display resolutions running games that way can create better immersion eg when playing video racing game flight simulator give tactical advantage due higher resolution augmented/ mixed reality graphics artist's illustration minecraft on microsoft hololens main articles augmented reality mixed reality augmented mixed reality game graphics use images that partial overlay image reality seen through partial transparent glasses captured with camera seen with head-mounted display other displays such smartphone tablet displays see also technical aspects game development portal computer graphics computer graphics real-time computer graphics rendering
